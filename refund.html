<h1>Refund Policy</h1>
<p>Last updated: January 26, 2026</p>

<p>Globeii is operated by Globeii, LLC. This Refund Policy explains our policies regarding subscription payments, cancellations, and refunds.</p>

<h2>1. Free Version</h2>
<p>Globeii offers a free version of the Services. No payment is required, and no refunds apply to free features.</p>

<h2>2. Paid Subscriptions</h2>
<p>Globeii offers monthly and yearly subscription plans through our web application. Subscriptions automatically renew unless canceled before the renewal date.</p>

<h3>2.1 Cancellation</h3>
<ul>
  <li>You may cancel your subscription at any time.</li>
  <li>Canceling a subscription stops future billing.</li>
  <li>Access to paid features continues until the end of the current billing period.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2.2 Refunds</h3>
<ul>
  <li>All subscription payments are non-refundable unless required by law.</li>
  <li>We generally do not issue refunds for partially used billing periods or accidental purchases.</li>
  <li>For billing errors or disputes, please contact us at <strong>support@globeii.app</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. Free Trials & Upgrades</h2>
<p>If you upgrade from the free plan to a paid subscription, you will be charged immediately. Refunds for upgrades or trial conversions are generally not provided, except as required by law.</p>

<h2>4. Enterprise / Team Plans</h2>
<p>Enterprise or team subscriptions are billed to the organization or account owner. Fees are based on the chosen plan and number of users.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Failure to manage team access does not entitle the account holder to refunds.</li>
  <li>Adjustments to team subscriptions (adding/removing users) are handled per plan terms; see your plan agreement for details.</li>
</ul>

<h2>5. Account Deletion</h2>
<p>Deleting your account immediately cancels any active subscription. You will not be charged further. Access ends immediately upon deletion, and no refunds are issued for the remaining billing period.</p>

<h2>6. Offline Data</h2>
<p>Any itineraries or other data downloaded to your device for offline use are your responsibility. Globeii is not liable for offline data loss or corruption. Deleting offline data is permanent.</p>

<h2>7. Third-Party Payments</h2>
<p>All payments are processed by third-party payment providers. We are not responsible for issues related to payment processing, card declines, chargebacks, or other payment errors. Refunds may require coordination with the payment provider.</p>
