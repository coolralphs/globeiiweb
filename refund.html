<h1>Refund Policy</h1>
<p>Last updated: January 26, 2026</p>

<p>
This Refund Policy applies to Globeii and all related services.
</p>

<h2>Free & Paid Plans</h2>
<p>
Globeii offers a free version with limited features. Paid subscription plans
unlock additional features and functionality.
</p>

<h2>Subscriptions</h2>
<p>
Paid subscriptions are available on a monthly or yearly basis and automatically
renew unless canceled before the renewal date.
</p>

<h2>Cancellation</h2>
<p>
You may cancel your subscription at any time through your account settings.
Canceling prevents future charges. Access to paid features will remain available
until the end of the current billing period.
</p>

<h2>Refunds</h2>
<p>
All fees are non-refundable. We do not provide refunds or credits for partial
billing periods, unused time, or unused features.
</p>

<p>
Refunds may only be issued where required by applicable law.
</p>

<h2>Account Deletion</h2>
<p>
Deleting your Globeii account automatically cancels any active subscriptions.
No further charges will occur. Access continues until the end of the billing period.
