<h1>Refund Policy</h1>
<p>Last updated: January 26, 2026</p>

<p>Globeii, LLC (“Globeii”, “we”, “our”, “us”) provides the following refund policy for paid subscriptions:</p>

<h2>1. Free Version</h2>
<p>The free version does not require payment. No refunds apply.</p>

<h2>2. Paid Subscriptions</h2>
<p>Paid subscriptions are non-refundable unless required by law. Users may cancel future renewals at any time, but access to paid features continues until the end of the current billing period. Refunds for unused time are generally not provided.</p>

<h2>3. Enterprise / Team Plans</h2>
<p>Enterprise or team subscriptions are billed to a single account owner or organization. Refunds or adjustments are not provided for unused seats or failure to manage user access. Terms may vary based on enterprise agreements.</p>

<h2>4. Trial Periods</h2>
<p>If a free trial converts to a paid subscription, standard refund rules apply. Users must cancel before the trial ends to avoid charges.</p>

<h2>5. Account Deletion & Data</h2>
<p>Deleting your account immediately cancels subscriptions and removes all itineraries, notes, shared access, and offline data. Refunds will not be provided for deleted accounts unless required by law.</p>

<h2>6. Contact</h2>
